### Professional Experience

**Director of Engineering** [LearnArena](https://learnarena.com/) – Remote (Jacksonville FL \- Austin TX)  
July 2022 to Present  
Learn Arena is a pioneering competitive learning platform where top-performing students have the opportunity to recoup course costs or even earn a profit. As a founding developer, I led the evolution of Learn Arena from a hobbyist React and Firebase app to a scalable NextJS application with MySQL, leveraging TRPC and Prisma. To facilitate this transition, I developed a custom database migration tool to move our Firebase data into a relational SQL database, as no suitable tool existed at the time. Additionally, I built one of the world’s first AI-driven course creators, capable of generating 60 hours of educational content—including practice challenges, code editors, and CodePen embeds—from a single topic phrase. 

**Software Engineer** [Marketplacer](https://www.marketplacer.com/) – Remote (Jacksonville FL)  
April 2022 to May 2023  
As a core developer for the Marketplacer Connected platform, I built critical Shopify and Adobe Commerce connectors, enabling seamless data flow through an extensive Rails API system. This solution allows enterprises to manage a fleet of eCommerce websites from a unified dashboard, incorporating major platforms like Shopify, Adobe Commerce, Salesforce, and BigCommerce.

**Senior Developer** [Izoox](https://www.izoox.com/) \- Longmont, CO  
October 2018 to March 2022  
As Lead Developer at Izoox, a hosting and software development company, I played a key role in building, maintaining, and managing projects for clients ranging from small businesses to large enterprises. Izoox specializes in elevating existing websites into modern, high-performance web applications, tailored to meet the unique needs of each client. I engineered scalable APIs for major clients like [Rug Doctor](https://www.rugdoctor.com/) and majorly contributed to the development of websites for prominent brands such as [Blue Hawaiian Helicopters](https://www.bluehawaiian.com/en), among many others.  
   
**Marketing and Content Management** [Khorus Enterprises](https://www.khorus.com/) \- Austin, TX  
June 2017 to July 2018  
At Khorus Enterprises, a pioneering goal-setting organization, I started in marketing with a focus on lead generation and content management. During this time, I developed a strong interest in software development by creating web-scraping tools in Excel to streamline lead generation. This experience sparked my passion for programming, which I pursued further with guidance from an in-house Ruby developer, helping me build a solid foundation in development.

### Education

Praxis \- Austin, TX  
2017 to 2018

### Notable Projects

**AI Course Creator \- Python with SQLAlchemy, Redis, Vue**  
[AI Course Creator \- Github](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/ai-course-creator)  
   
Starting in 2022, I created one of the world’s first AI Course Creation softwares, capable of generating 60 hours of educational material given just a single topic phrase, and complete with interactive questions, including multiple choice questions, fill in the blank, code editors, and even codepen embeds. It uses a custom-built Python event/handler architecture with a Vue frontend. This is one of the coolest, if not the coolest, things I’ve ever built.

**Marketplacer Connected \- Ruby on Rails**  
[Marketplacer Connected Technology](https://www.marketplacer.com/implementation/connected/)  
   
As a central developer on the "Connected" platform within the highly sophisticated Marketplacer ecosystem, I contributed significantly to the development of a triad of interconnected Rails applications catering to Marketplacer, Shopify, and Adobe Commerce. These applications were unified by a robust event-driven RailsEventStore engine listening for events across all connectors. Our team adhered to rigorous test-driven development practices, aiming for comprehensive code coverage for all new features. Despite the platform's complexity, the codebase was exceptionally clean, providing me a profound understanding of the importance and implementation of 'clean code'.

**Rug Doctor – Ruby on Rails API**  
[Rug Doctor](https://www.rugdoctor.com/)  
   
Led the overhaul of Rug Doctor's Ruby on Rails API, which serves as the core connection to all front-end clients. Addressed significant technical debt and scalability issues inherited from previous designs. Simultaneously developed new features including an online order-driver delivery system. Successfully rebuilt critical API components, notably the refunds process, rectifying previous development failures.  
   
**Blue Hawaiian Helicopters – PHP Laravel on LAMP stack**  
[Blue Hawaiian Helicopters \- Best Helicopter Tours in Hawaii](https://www.bluehawaiian.com/en)  
   
This website was built by myself and a senior colleague over the course of about 6 months. Blue Hawaiian is the largest helicopter touring company in Hawaii. We created a feature-rich platform that offers detailed information and booking options for helicopter tours across all four major Hawaiian islands \- Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island​​ and uses a custom booking engine.

Developed a prototype for an automatic weights and balances system for Blue Hawaiian Helicopters that optimized passenger seating based on weight distribution, enhancing aircraft stability. Though budget constraints prevented official implementation, I pursued the project independently. A simplified JavaScript version is accessible on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/helicopter-weights-balance-calculator).

**GPT Conversations – PHP Laravel with Inertia JS and Vue3**  
[gptconversations.app](https://gptconversations.app/)  
I recently launched a unique application that enables LLM models to autonomously interact, simulating intriguing AI-generated conversations. With over a thousand such conversations already facilitated, I am actively integrating 'Bard' to further enhance the app's capabilities and user engagement. Currently it's set up to continuously talk to itself on "phenomena lacking clear explanations but solvable using all human knowledge."

**Drone Project \- Face Tracking**  
[Drone Tracking My Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTdS4-Tas6E)  
[https://github.com/AlextheYounga/tello-controller](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/tello-controller)  
I love programming drones and experimenting with drone software in my spare time. I programmed my drone to track my face and follow me around my house. Check out the Youtube video above.

**VIX Volatility Calculator – Python**  
[vix-vol-calculator \- GitHub](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/vix-vol-calculator)  
I engineered a program capable of calculating the [CBOE VIX Volatility](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/futures/vixwhite.pdf?msclkid=89949b97aa2b11ecadebe38bb86dc6ae) number for any stock, marking, to my understanding, the most accurate implementation of the VIX equation available on GitHub, and the only program that allows a user to run the equation on any stock. The process of meticulously understanding the underlying math and implementing the program, completed over two weeks, was extremely interesting and I dare say, “fun”.

**Congress Stock Trades Bot – Python, Django, Numpy, MatPlotLib**  
[Congress Stock Trades Bot \- @hazlittresearch](https://twitter.com/hazlittresearch)  
As a passionate explorer of stock market complexities and statistical math, I developed an array of stock trading programs aimed at analyzing market volatility and potential trading patterns. These programs were subsequently utilized in the creation of a Twitter bot, with the primary intent of posting outputs of my various programs. A notable feature of this bot was its ability to extract and tweet stock transactions made by Congress members, as disclosed under the Stock Act. This unique integration garnered significant public interest, leading to an invitation to discuss the bot on the KWOS Morning Radio Show.

While the bot is no longer maintained as of 2022 due to superior alternatives emerging, I take pride in this pioneering endeavor. Many of the initial programs and the Twitter bot's codebase are open-sourced on my GitHub account under the [stock-market-programs](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/fractal-markets-lab) repository.
