A key feature is its compatibility with SQL databases, originally employing Knex and Bookshelf as database ORMs until the emergence of a superior alternative, Prisma. In addition to these features, I've engineered an IPC API to facilitate seamless interaction with a Vue frontend integrated with Tailwind CSS. This project underlines my commitment to creating tools that enhance developer productivity and experience.</span></p>",
