When I was first placed on managing this site, it was in a rough state, as previous developers had completely disregarded all concepts of clean code. This became a passion project of mine as I, along with the rest of my team, slowly nursed this site back to health. Unfortunately, along with many other helicopter touring companies, operation under Covid19 became financially impossible, and the company was forced to shut down. Shutting down the site was a very sad day for all of us. I have set up a link to the WayBack machine of August 11th of 2020, the last recorded snapshot of the site before we posted the notification that Sundance was shutting down all operations.</p>",
